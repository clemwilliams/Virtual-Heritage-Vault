# 🌍 Virtual Heritage Vault: Tokenized Global Cultural Experiences

## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Virtual Heritage Vault** is a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It enables communities, museums, and cultural custodians to tokenize virtual reality (VR) experiences of cultural heritage sites, artifacts, or traditions. These tokenized experiences are preserved immutably, accessible globally, and monetizable, ensuring cultural preservation and economic empowerment.

### Problem Addressed
- **Cultural Heritage Loss**: Physical sites and artifacts face risks from natural disasters, war, or neglect.
- **Restricted Access**: Many people cannot visit heritage sites due to geographic, financial, or political barriers.
- **Funding Gaps**: Cultural institutions often lack resources to preserve or promote heritage.

### Solution
- **Tokenized VR Experiences**: Create NFTs representing VR experiences of cultural heritage (e.g., 3D tours of ancient ruins, virtual artifact galleries, or traditional performances).
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Communities own and control their tokenized heritage assets.
- **Global Access**: Anyone can purchase or access these VR experiences via NFTs.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Proceeds from NFT sales fund preservation efforts and benefit local communities.

## ✨ Features
- 🖼 **Tokenize VR Experiences**: Mint NFTs for VR experiences with metadata (e.g., 3D models, cultural context).
- 🔒 **Immutable Provenance**: Record ownership and authenticity on the blockchain.
- 💸 **Revenue Distribution**: Automatically distribute earnings to communities and creators.
- 🌐 **Global Marketplace**: Buy, sell, or rent access to VR experiences.
- 🗳 **Community Governance**: Allow stakeholders to vote on platform decisions.
- 🔍 **Verification**: Verify authenticity and ownership of tokenized experiences.
- 📊 **Analytics**: Track usage and impact of VR experiences.

## 🛠 How It Works
### For Cultural Custodians
1. Upload a VR experience (e.g., 3D model or video) and generate a unique hash.
2. Mint an NFT via the `HeritageNFT` contract, including metadata (title, description, cultural context).
3. List the NFT on the `Marketplace` contract for sale or rental.
4. Set revenue-sharing terms using the `RevenueShare` contract to distribute earnings to community wallets.

### For Users
1. Browse the marketplace to purchase or rent VR experience NFTs.
2. Use the `AccessControl` contract to gain temporary or permanent access to VR content.
3. Verify authenticity and ownership via the `Verification` contract.

### For Communities
1. Propose new VR experiences or platform upgrades via the `Governance` contract.
2. Receive automatic payouts from NFT sales through the `RevenueShare` contract.
